To use them, first edit the \"hosts\" inventory file to contain the\nhostnames of the machines on which you want JBoss deployed, and edit the \ngroup_vars/all file to set any JBoss configuration parameters you need.\n\nThen run the playbook, like this:\n\n\tansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml\n\nWhen the playbook run completes, you should be able to see the JBoss\nApplication Server running on the ports you chose, on the target machines.\n\nThis is a very simple playbook and could serve as a starting point for more\ncomplex JBoss-based projects. \n\n## Application deployment\n\nThe playbook deploy-application.yml may be used to deploy the HelloWorld and Ticket Monster demo applications to JBoss hosts that have been deployed using site.yml, as above.\n\nRun the playbook using:\n\n\tansible-playbook -i hosts deploy-application.yml\n\t\nThe HelloWorld application will be available at `http://<jboss server>:<http_port>/helloworld`\n\nThe Ticket Monster application will be available at `http://<jboss server>:<http_port>/ticket-monster`\n\n## Provisioning for Amazon Web Services\n\nA simple playbook is provided, as an example, to provision hosts in preparation for running this JBoss deployment example.\n\n\tansible-playbook -i hosts demo-aws-launch.yml\n\n### Ideas for Improvement\n\nHere are some ideas for ways that these playbooks could be extended:\n\n- Write a playbook or an Ansible module to configure JBoss users.\n- Extend this configuration to multiple application servers fronted by a load\nbalancer or other web server frontend.\n\nWe would love to see contributions and improvements, so please fork this\nrepository on GitHub and send us your changes via pull requests.\n"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":1841}]],"length":1841}
